# Migration Scripts for a very unique AD migration 
Scripts for a complex migration scenario that involves multiple forests; including a source user forest, target user forest, target exchange resource forest, and a target exchange admin forest.  ADMT was used to migrate user objects into both the target user forest for identity, and the target exchange forest for the linked shadow account.  For this migration, ADMT was used to first migrate the users from the source domain into the target user domain, and into the target exchange resource domain/forest.  Your mileage may vary :)
